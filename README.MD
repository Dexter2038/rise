# ü¶Ä rise (rust initial setup engine)

> The unofficial, community-driven way to kickstart modern Rust projects.

Whether you're building a web apps, CLI tool, game, or something embedded and weird, 
`rise` helps you spin up opinionated templates fast ‚Äî with support for async runtimes, 
frameworks like Axum, Bevy, and more.

Choose your stack, generate the boilerplate, and ship something spicy.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Not published on `crates.io` yet

This project is still under active development. There's no `cargo install rise` ‚Äî **yet**.

--

## Quick Start (for the impatient)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dexter2038/rise
cd rise
cargo run
```

Yes, it's that simple. No, we don't have a fancy installer yet.

## Future roadmap teaser

-[] `cargo install rise` (when we're fancy)

-[] Better error handling with crates like `thiserror`

Selection for:
-[] WebApps
-[] CLI
-[] Gamedev
-[] Embedded
-[] Libraries
- More, you're free to give more ideas!

Generation for:
-[] WebApps
-[] CLI
-[] Gamedev
-[] Embedded
-[] Libraries
- More (if you wish to add something)

## The vision

The goal is to support multiple kinds of Rust projects with plug-and-play templates

Bring your own templates or use the ones bundled in. The vision is modular, and as little boilerplate pain as possible.

Things are moving fast. Expect rough edges, TODOs, and probably a few panics. Contributions, feedback, and chaos-testing welcome.

It's not official. It's better.

Let me know if you want badges, install sections for the future, or a snarkier "FAQ" for people who inevitably ask why it's not on crates.io yet.

## üíª Contributing

Found a panic? Have a killer template idea? Maybe you just want to build this thing too? Open an issue or PR. 
We're building this thing together.
